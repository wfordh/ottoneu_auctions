# Ottoneu Auctions

This repository runs a script to help decision making in free agent auctions for my Ottoneu league and deploys the gathered information in HTML tables to a web page using GitHub actions and pages.

## Usage

## How It Works

## TO DO
- Figure out why `playerid_lookup()` prints the message each time. Either get it to stop printing each time or find a way to filter that out of the web page.
- Stretch goal for this project is to make it possible to enter your league number and get that day's auctions, which effectively extends it to any league. Streamlit and PyWebIO are options.
- Refactor so logic and UI are more effectively split. May require making a class
- Curate columns for HTML more
- Add Fangraphs' projections for RoS
