# Ottoneu Auctions

This repository runs a script to help decision making in free agent auctions for my Ottoneu league and deploys the gathered information in HTML tables to a web page using GitHub actions and pages.

## Usage

## How It Works

## TO DO
- Figure out why `playerid_lookup()` prints the message each time. Either get it to stop printing each time or find a way to filter that out of the web page.
- Extend it to both of my leagues, preferably with an index page that links to individual pages for each league.
- Stretch goal for this project is to make it possible to enter your league number and get that days auctions, which effectively extends it to any league.
- Move to environment variables for league IDs
- Refactor so logic and UI are more effectively split. May require making a class
- Add date to HTML
- Curate columns for HTML more
